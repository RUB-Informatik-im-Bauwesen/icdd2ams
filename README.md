# Asset Condition Integration from information containers into relational Asset Management databases (icdd2ams)

This repository contains ontologies, data, queries, and source code presented in "BIM-based organization of inspection data using Semantic Web technology for infrastructure asset management" published at EUROSTRUCT 2021 conference. It includes a minimal ABox ontology for integrating  asset conditions located using [Building Topology Ontology (BOT)](https://github.com/w3c-lbd-cg/bot) within an [Information Container for linked document delivery (ICDD)](https://www.iso.org/standard/74389.html) into SQL-based asset management systems. See the following files:

### Code
- [`src/main/java/org/iib/icdd2ams/ToSQL.java`](src/main/java/org/iib/icdd2ams/ToSQL.java): inferring the sample data set with the given rule set to the resulting inferred data set 
- [`src/main/java/org/iib/icdd2ams/ToSQLTemplate.java`](src/main/java/org/iib/icdd2ams/ToSQLTemplate.java): generating an SQL insert query form a SPARQL Template (STTL) 
 
### Resources [input]
- [`src/main/resources/ams/input/amsData.ttl`](src/main/resources/ams/input/amsData.ttl): sample data set for inferring SQL Data 
- [`src/main/resources/ams/input/insertData.ttl`](src/main/resources/ams/input/insertData.ttl): sample data set for the generation of SQL INSERT query using STTL 
- [`src/main/resources/ams/input/amsSqlData.ttl`](src/main/resources/ams/input/amsSqlData.ttl): sample data set extracted from SQL database 
- [`src/main/resources/ams/input/sql/20210610_AMS_database_draft.sql`](src/main/resources/ams/input/sql/20210610_AMS_database_draft.sql): SQL dump of the database used for the extraction of structural information 

### Resources [mappings]
- [`src/main/resources/ams/mappings/query.rqg`](src/main/resources/ams/mappings/query.rqg): sample SPARQL template for generating SQL INSERT query using STTL
- [`src/main/resources/ams/mappings/amsRules.ttl`](src/main/resources/ams/mappings/amsRules.ttl): general mapping rules for inferring `bot:Element` and `eurotl:InspectionActivity` into SQL Schema 
- [`src/main/resources/ams/mappings/amsicdd.ttl`](src/main/resources/ams/mappings/amsicdd.ttl) : Ontology for adding relations between `bot`, `eurotl` and `asbing`, see [Documentation](https://icdd.vm.rub.de/ontology/icdd2ams/)
